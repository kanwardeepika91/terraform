## Terraform AWS simple tasks

# Additional info:

`1) Destroy everything as soon you code is succesfully deployed in AWS otherwise it will incur cost if you forget any instances running
2) command: `terraform destroy` or `terraform apply -destroy` : -> deletes all infrastructure after your confirmation
3) other commands can be copied from for terraform execution "1.terraform-local" README.md`
